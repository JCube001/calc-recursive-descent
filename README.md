# Calc

An implementation of a recursive descent parser and evaluator for a simple infix arithmetic language. Includes a library and interpreter components. I made this simply to practice writing a lexer and parser in C++. An EBNF definition of the grammar is available in the `doc` directory.

## Build

To build this project you will need CMake and a C++17 or later compiler.
